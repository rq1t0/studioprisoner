    "q": "Do you accept mixing-only projects?",
    "a": [
      "Yes, we do ‚Äî but with one important condition: you must be able to self-produce your recording materials.",
      "If you believe that ‚Äúa good mix alone will make a good record,‚Äù that‚Äôs a common misconception.",
      "While mixing is indeed a crucial process that can make a song sound great, the truth is that there are countless elements in the recording stage that determine the quality of the final product long before the mix begins.",
      "Most of the works produced at STUDIO PRISONER are projects I‚Äôve been involved with since the recording stage, and in many cases, even from pre-production (rehearsal/demo planning).",
      "That means a tremendous amount of preparation goes into tracking before the mixing process even starts.",
      "Music and sound are built through a continuous chain of creative steps.",
      "At every stage, there must be a consistent vision and clear direction toward the final goal.",
      "In fact, I believe the overall quality of a work is largely determined during pre-production ‚Äî that‚Äôs the foundation of how I approach every project at STUDIO PRISONER.",
      "So if you‚Äôre unsure about self-producing, uncertain about how to handle recording, or working remotely, I strongly recommend consulting with me beforehand.",
      "Even for mixing-only projects, early feedback and shared preparation can dramatically improve the final result."
